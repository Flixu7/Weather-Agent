# Weather-Agent

A badass script that grabs your city’s weather every day and sends you a heads-up via SMS. No fluff, just straight info so you’re never caught off guard by the weather.

## How it works

- Runs daily with GitHub Actions (set your schedule)  
- Fetches weather data from API  
- Sends SMS through Twilio  
- Configurable via `.env` file – keep your secrets locked tight

## Setup

1. Clone repo  
2. Put your API keys and settings in `.env`  
3. Push and let GitHub Actions do the magic

## Why bother?

Because guessing the weather sucks. Get the alert, stay ready.
